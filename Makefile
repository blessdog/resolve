# resolve — the gate.
#
# Nothing in this repo ran its own tests until 2026-08-03. Eight test files
# existed and were executed only when someone remembered, which is why AGENTS.md
# drifted two tools and fourteen flags in a day. `make check` is now the single
# entry point, and .githooks/pre-commit refuses commits that break it.
#
#   make hooks       once per clone — installs the pre-commit gate
#   make check       offline gate; what the hook runs; needs no Resolve
#   make check-live  full suite; needs Resolve OPEN with no modal dialog
#
# OFFLINE and LIVE together must list every tests/test_*.py — tests/test_docs.py
# asserts that, so a new test cannot be silently left out of the gate.
